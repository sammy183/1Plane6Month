Follow along as I attempt to learn aircraft design properly. It'll be a difficult learning experience, but I'm excited to get started.

Projects:

SN-1: RC COTS aircraft <100Wh, maximize range;
FW, HL (Flying Wing, Hand Launched) (started 8/17/2025 (tabled due to DBF 2026 + UAVDEX work, hopefully will resume over winter break)
