# 1Plane6Month

Follow along as I attempt to learn aircraft design properly. It'll be a difficult learning experience, but I'm excited to get started. The goal is to have a fully fleshed out configuration every six months.

Checklist for single config completion:
1. OpenVSP models
2. Conceptual Layouts
3. Standard Performance Estimations:
CL, CD sweeps (including at least one RANS simulation), EM diagrams for altitude and turn, stability derivatives and coefficients, refined weight estimation, range/endurance/takeoff/landing estimations

Projects:

SN-1: RC COTS aircraft <100Wh, maximize range;
FW, HL (Flying Wing, Hand Launched) (started 8/17/2025, tabled due to DBF 2026 + UAVDEX work, hopefully will resume over winter break)



Learning OpenVSP:
2025 OpenVSP workshop: https://openvsp.org/wiki/doku.php?id=workshop2025
OpenVSP ground school: https://vspu.larc.nasa.gov/

Best Accessible Softwares:
OpenVSP: https://openvsp.org/
XFOIL: https://web.mit.edu/drela/Public/web/xfoil/ (anything by Drela is gold)
QPROP: https://web.mit.edu/drela/Public/web/qprop/
MSES: https://web.mit.edu/drela/Public/web/mses/
Digital DATCOM; https://www.pdas.com/datcom.html (note: the pdas table of contents has many other useful softwares)
XFLR5: https://www.xflr5.tech/xflr5.htm
Hopefully UAVDEX when it's ready for electric aircraft propulsion

Aircraft Design:
- Aircraft Design: A Conceptual Approach, Seventh Edition; Dan Raymer; 2024
- Fundamentals of Aircraft and Airship Design; Leland M. Nicolai and Grant E. Carichner; 2010
- The Design of the Airplane, Second Edition; Darrol Stinton; 2001
- Airplane Design I-VIII; Jan Roskam; 1985
- https://ntrs.nasa.gov/ <-- by far the best online resource for aircraft analysis. I have a stockpile of wartime NACA reports at home. Work by Theodorsen, Polhamus, Whitcomb still extremely relevant (and often replicated in DATCOM/Raymer)
