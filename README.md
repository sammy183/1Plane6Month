# 1Plane6Month

Follow along as I attempt to learn aircraft design properly. It'll be a difficult learning experience, but I'm excited to get started. The goal is to have a fully fleshed out configuration every six months.

Checklist for single config completion:
1. OpenVSP model
2. Conceptual Layout
3. Standard Performance Estimations:
CL, CD sweeps (including at least one RANS simulation), EM diagrams for altitude and turn, stability derivatives and coefficients, refined weight estimation, range/endurance/takeoff/landing estimations

Projects:

SN-1: RC COTS aircraft <100Wh, maximize range;
FW, HL (Flying Wing, Hand Launched) (started 8/17/2025, tabled due to DBF 2026 + UAVDEX work, hopefully will resume over winter break)
